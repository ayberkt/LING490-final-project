# LING490 Final Project

I began the implementation of the project and am using this repo to do the
development. The proposal is now in the director `proposal`; you may feel free
to ignore the other files. Thanks!

## TODO
- [ ] Correctly isolate sentences from each other
- [ ] When counting frequencies of words, include each possible POS
      of all words. This should increase the accuracy.
- [ ] I might be able to increase the accuracy by filtering some of the
      data from the treebank e.g. ignoring commas might increase accuracy.
- [x] Avoid warnings; this is a hard one since I will have to modify `Data.HMM`.
