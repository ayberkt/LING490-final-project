# LING490 Final Project

I began the implementation of the project and am using this repo to do the
development. The proposal is now in the director `proposal`; you may feel free
to ignore the other files. Thanks!

## TODO
- [ ] Correctly isolate sentences from each other
- [ ] When counting frequencies of words, include each possible POS
of all words. This should increase the accuracy.
- [ ] Avoid warnings; this is a hard one since I will have to modify `Data.HMM`.
